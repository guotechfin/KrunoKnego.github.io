            I am a software engineer who likes to share his knowledge. One reason I've created this blog
            is so I can help myself to quickly find solutions to problems I've already solved. The other reason
            is to educate others and vice versa.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently I'm interested in topics such as: Symfony2, Doctrine2, DevOps and PHP in general.
            In near future expect of me to write about Networks (Cisco), NodeJS and AngularJS.
            From time to time I also might write about topics that aren't related to software development.
