I'm a passionate web developer that constantly tries to improve himself. My tool of choice for all my web
development is PHP. Now like every other sane person I'm using PHP frameworks. For a while I used Codeigniter but when
I found out about Symfony2 I simply fell in love with it.

From time to time you can find me doing some mobile development. I know my way around Android and in my free time
I'm trying to learn how to develop for iOS.
