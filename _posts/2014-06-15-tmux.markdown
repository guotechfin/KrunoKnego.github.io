## What is TMUX and why should you use it?

TMUX stands for terminal multiplexer. It lets you easily switch between programs.
You can detach and later attach to a tmux session.

So why should you use it? I'm a web developer and I found using tmux the most when
I have a symfony2 command to execute which takes lots of time but I have to use terminal
to do other things too. So I simply open a new session using tmux, call my symfony2 command,
detach from it and continue with my job.

## How to install TMUX?

{% highlight php5 %}
    sudo apt-get install tmux
{% endhighlight %}


## How to use TMUX?

To create new session you write

{% highlight php5 %}
    tmux new
{% endhighlight %}

You'll be logged in your tmux session and when you're finished you detach from it.
To detach from your session you press CTRL + B and then press D.

To list all your sessions you use:

{% highlight php5 %}
    tmux ls
{% endhighlight %}

Every session that is listed is prepended with a number unless you named your session.

So to attach for example to session prepended with number 0 you simply execute:

{% highlight php5 %}
    tmux attach -t 0
{% endhighlight %}

To kill session 0 you write the following command:

{% highlight php5 %}
    tmux kill-session -t 0
{% endhighlight %}
